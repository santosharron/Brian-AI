## Reporting a Vulnerability

First, head over to GitHub repository's "**Issues**" tab and click on the "**New issue**" button. From there, select the "**Bug report**" option and fill out the form with as much detail as possible about the vulnerability you have discovered.

Once you have submitted the vulnerability report, you can expect to receive updates on its status from the repository maintainer. Depending on the severity of the vulnerability, you may receive updates more frequently or less frequently. In general, you can expect to hear back within a few days to a week.

If the vulnerability is accepted, We will work to fix the issue and release a security patch as soon as possible. You can expect to be notified when the patch has been released and the vulnerability has been fixed.

If the vulnerability is declined, the repository maintainer will provide an explanation as to why it was declined. This may be due to a number of factors, including the severity of the vulnerability, the feasibility of fixing it, or other factors. In some cases, the maintainer may ask for more information or suggest a different course of action.

In any case, it is important to report vulnerabilities as soon as possible so that they can be addressed and the security of your software can be maintained.
